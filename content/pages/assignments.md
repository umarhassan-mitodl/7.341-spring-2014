Written Assignment (Due Week 7)
-------------------------------

Students will be provided with only the figures and captions from a published paper and asked to interpret the data in the form of an abstract describing the paper. The abstract should provide a brief introduction to the paper's topic, a summary of the results, and an interpretation of the significance and broader impact of the results. Do Not Look Up The Paper.

Oral Presentation (Due in the Final Class)
------------------------------------------

Students will be provided with a list of articles selected by the instructors but not discussed in class. Students will choose a paper to discuss, either from this list or from their own literature search. Paper choice must be approved by instructors by Week 8. Papers will be presented via a 15-minute oral presentation followed by a 5-minute group discussion / Q&A. The presentation should provide a critical analysis, rather than just a summary, of the data, the controls, and the published interpretations. The presenter should also discuss the relevance of the paper to the course topic and the field and whether the authorsâ€™ conclusions were justified, and suggest potential follow-up experiments and directions.
